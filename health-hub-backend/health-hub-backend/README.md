## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Serverless Framework CLI (`npm install -g serverless`)
- AWS CLI (configured with your AWS credentials)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
health-hub-backend/
├── .serverless/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│   └── services/
│       ├── ai-interaction-service/
│       ├── appointment-service/
│       ├── doctor-service/
│       ├── patient-service/
│       └── user-service/
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── serverless-compose.yml
```

Each service in the `src/services/` directory has its own `serverless.yml` configuration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/health-hub-backend.git
   cd health-hub-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install dependencies for each service:
   ```bash
   for service in src/services/*; do
     (cd "$service" && npm install)
   done
   ```

## Deployment

Before deploying, ensure that all the necessary credentials and environment variables are properly set in each service's `serverless.yml` file.

To deploy all services:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Service-Specific Notes

### AI Interaction Service

- Integrates with text-to-speech capabilities

### Other Services

- appointment-service: Manages appointment scheduling and retrieval
- doctor-service: Handles doctor-related operations
- patient-service: Manages patient information and records
- user-service: Handles user authentication and profile management

Each of these services should have their specific configurations in their respective `serverless.yml` files.

## Security Notes

- Never commit sensitive information like API keys or credential files to version control.
- For production deployments, consider using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store to securely manage your credentials and API keys.
- Regularly rotate your API keys and update them in your serverless configurations.
- Implement proper IAM roles and policies to restrict access to AWS resources.

Remember to keep your API keys and sensitive information secure. Use AWS Parameter Store or Secrets Manager for managing secrets in production environments.
